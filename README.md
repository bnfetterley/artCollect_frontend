# artCollect
<!-- A little info about your project and/ or overview that explains what the project is about. -->

artCollect is an app that allows you to discover artworks and share your favorite pieces in your own collection.

## Motivation
<!-- A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain why the project exists. -->
I have always loved hearing other's perspectives on art pieces. It is interesting to learn what they see, ponder and feel when they experience a piece. This app is a great way to dive into that knowledge that is typically kept to ourselves.
